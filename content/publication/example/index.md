abstract: Locomotion is one of the most basic interactions in virtual reality
  applications, and many techniques have been developed for moving in virtual
  environments. However, each technique works well in different scenarios, and
  is tested and evaluated in different test environments and on different tasks.
  To date, there has not been a common standard test bed which accommodates
  long, medium and short distance travel that would support testing and
  comparing locomotion techniques. This paper describes a novel testing
  environment for VR locomotion techniques, and explains the parameters that can
  be manipulated depending on the locomotion technique and the task. It also
  discusses the other possible attributes that can be included in future
  versions of the test environment.
